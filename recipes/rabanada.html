        <!--name of the recipe-->
        <p>This Brazilian breakfast treat is usually served around Christmastime. Being soaked overnight, it makes for a festive holiday brunch item. Cooking the toast long enough for the outside to get crispy still leaves it with a custard-like interior that melts in the mouth. <!--Create a paragraph or two with descriptive information about the recitpe--></p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Cut bread into 1-inch thick slices on the bias. You should get about 16 pieces. If you have more, adjust other ingredients to compensate.</li>
                    <li>Whisk together the eggs, condensed milk, whole milk, vanilla extract, and salt until well mixed.</li>
                    <li>Coat bread slices on both sides in the egg mixture, and place coated bread in a shallow pan or pie plate, add any remaining egg mixture to it. Cover with press and seal wrap or foil and place in the refrigerator to soften overnight.</li>
                    <li>Mix together sugar, cocoa and cinnamon in a small shallow bowl big enough to hold one slice bread.</li>
                    <li>Heat oil in a deep skillet to about 2-inches until it reaches 330F (use a candy thermometer to check).</li>
                    <li>Lift the bread from the egg mixture until it stops dripping, and pan fry the pieces in the skillet on both sides until golden and crispy. Keep the oil hot while frying (check temp), raising the heat if needed.</li>
                    <li>As the pieces are removed from the skillet, drain on paper towels then dredge in the spicy sugar mixture.
                    </li>
