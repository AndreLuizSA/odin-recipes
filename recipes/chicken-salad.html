                <ol>
                    <li>In an instant pot. sauté the brazilian sofrito or the minced onion and garlic on olive oil for aboutr 2 minutes</li>
                    <li>Add the chicken, and season it with salt and pepper. Cook it for a minute on each side so that the seasoning's flavor can be transferred to the chicken. Add water and a chicken bouilon cube and cook it for about 25 minutes</li>
                    <li>In the meantime, you can prepare and cut the other ingredients.</li>
                    <li>Once the time has passed, safely release the pan's pressure and transfer the cooked chicken to a bowl using tongs</li>
                    <li>Using two forks or a wooden spoon, shred the chicken--it's very, very easy! Let it cool to room temperature. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>n the meantime, gently mix the carrots, peas, yellow corn, raisins, parsley, and green onions in a large bowl.</li>
                    <li>In a medium bowl, add the mayo, heavy cream, and mustard (the dressing ingredients) and mix them until incorporated.</li>
                    <li>Add the shredded chicken to the large bowl with vegetables and add the dressing. Mix it well.</li>
                    <li>Season with white wine vinegar, salt, and black pepper. Transfer the salad to a beautiful serving dish.</li>
                    <li>Top it with some potato sticks for a crunchy texture and garnish the serving bowl with lettuce leaves, if you want.</li>
                    <li>If you can't find potato sticks (shoestring potatoes), you can use crumbled potato chips instead. It works just fine.</li>
                    <li>Cover the bowl and refrigerate for half an hour or until chilled.
                    </li>
                    <li>Bom apetite!</li>
